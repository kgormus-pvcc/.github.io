<body>
    <p>May 23, 1957 city of Cleveland police officers approached the home of Miss Dollree Mapp looking for a person they believed to be hiding. The person Police were looking for needed to be brought in for
    questioning regarding a recent bombing but Miss Mapp would not allow the police to enter her home and contacted her attorney. Her attorney advised not to let them in the home without a search warrant. Miss
    Mapp was a woman known for gambling and boxing to Police. After Police were unable to enter the home they staked out the home and began their surveillance developing a plan to force their way into the home.
    Three hours later the officers barged in the door, Miss Mapp was almost to the entry way door when Police intruded into her home. Mapp asked for a search warrant and was provided a piece of paper which she 
    took and stuck in her shirt. Mapp never saw what the paper said because Police immediately tried getting the paper from her and a scuffle developed. After the scuffle with the police and Miss Mapp, they 
    contained Miss Mapp for being belligerent. Meanwhile Miss Mapp's attorney is present at the home but police are not allowing the attorney to see Miss Mapp or enter the home. After Police were able to obtain the 
    paper from Miss Mapp they roughly placed her in handcuffs and took her to the second floor of the home where they proceeded to search through her bedroom and personal paperwork. They continued searching all of
    the second floor including the child's bedroom, kitchen, living room and basement. During the search in the basement, Police went through a trunk and found obscene material. After not finding the individual they
    were looking for, entering Miss Mapp's home with a fake warrant and causing chaos police charged Miss Mapp for possessing pornography.</p> 
    <p>During Miss Mapp's trial in the Ohio court, her lawyer argued to dismiss the charges siting the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/232/383/#tab-opinion-1925421">1914 Weeks case</a> but he failed to fight the claim of the unlawful evidence obtained by the police. The 1914 Weeks
    Case was determined that without any search warrant and in violation of the constitutional rights, any evidence found would not be permissible in Federal courts. Since Miss Mapp was in the Ohio state court and
    her attorney did not find the Fourth Amendment right or Weeks trial evidence hard enough she was convicted of her charges. Miss Mapp was able to appeal this conviction stating her Fourth Amendment rights were 
    violated and her appeal went to the United States Supreme Court. </p>

<h2>The fight is on...</h2>
<h3>
<body>
    <p>During the trial in the United States Supreme Court no evidence was found of a search warrant and it was determined that the evidence found was unconstitutionally seized. Miss Mapp won her case on June 19, 1961
    in the United States Supreme Court over a vote of 5-3. Changing the laws for State courts stating evidence unlawfully seized cannot be used in criminal prosecutions in state courts. Justice Tom Clark stated 
    "nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the charter of its own existence." During the time of this trial Federal courts already banned 
    unlawfully seized evidence and with this ruling the same laws were now followed nationally.</p>
