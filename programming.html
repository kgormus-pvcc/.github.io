<h1>Chapter 5:Programming Algorithms & Software Testing
</h1>
<h2>Phases of computer programming development:
</h2>
    <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
    <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
    <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
    <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
    <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
<h2>Programming structures:</h2>
    <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
    <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
    <li>Iterative (Looping):</li>
        <dd>while loop: continue looping as long something is true repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true for loop: loop a given number of times</dd>
    <li>Recursive structures:</li>
        <dd>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</dd>
        <dd>Repetition continues until:</dd>
            <dd>degenerative case, which is termination condition, is met (degenerative case is also called a "base case")</dd>
<h2>Two classic programming/databse problems</h2>
    <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</li>
        <dd>Sorting numbers</dd>
        <dd>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</dd>
    <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
        <dd>In database:</dd>
            <dd>Filters: temporary search</dd>
            <dd>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</dd>
    <li>Two popular search techniques:
        <dd>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</dd>
        <dd>Binary search:</dd>
            <dd>only works if data is SORTED first</dd>
            <dd>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</dd>
<h2>Two classic program goals:</h2>
    <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
    <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
